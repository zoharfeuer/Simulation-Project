# Logistic Center Simulation Project - README

## Project Overview

The Logistic Center Simulation Project involves simulating the operation of a logistic center over multiple quarters. The simulation aims to analyze the efficiency of package handling and identify potential issues such as errors during pickup. The project utilizes various Python packages for data processing and visualization.

## Packages Used

The project utilizes the following Python packages:

- numpy: For numerical operations and random number generation.
- heapq: For managing the event log and scheduling events.
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib.pyplot: For data visualization using plots and charts.
- pylab: For additional plot configuration.
- random: For generating random values.

## Simulation Stages

The simulation is divided into several stages, as follows:

1. Event Class Creation: We define a class that represents different events occurring during the simulation.

2. Setting Up and Launch for First Event: The simulation for each quarter is set up, including logistic center package distribution and package handling. The first event, "pack_arrival," is launched to initialize the simulation.

3. Simulation Run: The simulation runs for each quarter, handling package arrivals, dispatches, pickups, and error fixes. It records and logs events, packages, and potential errors during the run.

## Running the Simulation

Before running the simulation, make sure you have installed the required Python packages. The main simulation code is organized in a series of stages and is part of the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

To execute the simulation, run the simulation code in your preferred Python environment or Jupyter Notebook. The simulation will produce results for each quarter, including package distribution, package handling statistics, and any identified errors.

## Conclusion

The Logistic Center Simulation Project provides a comprehensive analysis of logistic center operations over multiple quarters. By running the simulation and analyzing the results, we can gain insights into package handling efficiency and potential error occurrences during pickup. For a more detailed understanding, refer to the code implementation and visualizations in the project files.
